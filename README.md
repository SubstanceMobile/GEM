#### Contributing
If you want to contribute, go ahead! Just keep in mind that:
* Translations are accepted, but soon we will be switching to a different service so this will not apply.
* Keep it organised: we would be very grateful of you kept up with the proper syntax (naming variables properly, keeping up with the dev's bracket style, etc.)
* Your PR might be rejected, but the change may be applied in a different way. If so, the manager will have to point you to the commit(s) of the change.
* Please test your modifications (if you cannot test it for some reason, please just say so in the PR). Also, please mark the last commit you tested your PR with. We will take care of the rest.
* If your PR isn't compatible with other PRs, don't worry. The dev will fix it.
* These may be updated over time, so please keep watch.


#### Developing
Building GEM player is easy, and it is managed by the [Substance SDK](https://github.com/SubstanceMobile/SDK).
To build, see the documentation for the SDK Gradle Plugin [here](https://github.com/SubstanceMobile/sdk/tree/master/gradle-plugin/README.md)
